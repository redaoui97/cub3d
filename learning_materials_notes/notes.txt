initialize mlx mlx_init();
Open window mlx_new_window(game->mlx, game->screen_w, game->screen_h,"cub3D");
Create image pointer mlx_new_image(game->mlx, game->screen_w, game->screen_h);
set up img array mlx_get_data_addr

21/04:
+segfault on set_up_game/setting img arr on NULL values; Had to give bpp, size, endian
+added some variables to the img struct;
+added game loop
+added some functions ft_strlen fatal_error 

++fix makefile on mac branch


Variables needed:
pos_x pos_y 	position vector of the player in the map.
dir_x dir_y 	direction vector of the player in the map.
planX planY	camera plane of the player in the map.

Info:
- Camera plan should be perpendicular to the direction.
- FOV is a angle. (determined by the length of the direction and the camera plane)
- Direction is represented as double X and Y values between -1 and 1.
- 

Fix the raycaster: fix the rays issue, reconstructe the algorithm
map parser and game datastructure
color parser

Parsing: 
+parse file : 
-----------------------

the player in our example case starts close to the top left side of the square?
-fix segfault on backwards
	+check the lodev implementation and see how he managed to move
	potential fix:
		when going backwardds and tehn going leeft or right we should check that were not inside the Wall
		and reassign old values if we detect that we're.
	Second fix : add a ray function that casts on 3 directions: left, right, back and add a check function to hooks
-fix smoothness by adding the keypress and keyrelease
Game doesn't exit when clicking on x icon
