initialize mlx mlx_init();
Open window mlx_new_window(game->mlx, game->screen_w, game->screen_h,"cub3D");
Create image pointer mlx_new_image(game->mlx, game->screen_w, game->screen_h);
set up img array mlx_get_data_addr

21/04:
+segfault on set_up_game/setting img arr on NULL values; Had to give bpp, size, endian
+added some variables to the img struct;
+added game loop
+added some functions ft_strlen fatal_error 

++fix makefile on mac branch


Variables needed:
posX posY 	position vector of the player in the map.
dirX dirY 	direction vector of the player in the map.
planX planY	camera plane of the player in the map.

Info:
- Camera plan should be perpendicular to the direction.
- FOV is a angle. (determined by the length of the direction and the camera plane)
- Direction is represented as double X and Y values between -1 and 1.
- 

Fix the raycaster: fix the rays issue, reconstructe the algorithm
map parser and game datastructure
